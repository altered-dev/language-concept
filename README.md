# An unnamed programming language concept

This is a concept of a compiled general-purpose multi-paradigm programming language, very WIP at the moment. It is strongly inspired by many more popular languages, like Kotlin, Java, Rust etc, while providing a much simpler way to express things.

The main goal of the language is having **less rules and less exceptions from rules** without hurting the overall feel.

There are the more mainstream language features like basic flow control, functions, classes, structs, reflection etc., but features that can be easily replicated with something else are not present, like enums and abstract classes.

Check the [wiki](https://github.com/alt3r3dgd/language-concept/wiki) for details and an overview of the syntax.

Probably open for name ideas.
