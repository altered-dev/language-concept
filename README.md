# An unnamed programming language concept

This is a concept of a compiled statically typed multi-paradigm programming language which makes almost zero sense but somehow it should

The language follows a simple target: ***less rules and less exceptions from the rules.*** It would be pretty fast considering the lack of needing like 69420 things bundled into the compiler and the runtime.

For compiling and running the programs the language would follow a similar path to Java, C# etc. - compiling the source code into a bytecode of sort, then running it using a certain program installed on the end-user machine. Possibly something more interesting could be implemented.

So, let's see what this programming language *would* offer. ~~if I wasn't a lazyass~~
